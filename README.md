# Capstone 2: Restaurant Website - Miami Delights

For my Capstone 2 project, my team and I built a full-stack web application for a restaurant named **Miami Delights**. The restaurant requested several features, including:

- **Order Tracking**: Allowing customers to track their orders in real-time.
- **Payment Processing**: Seamless and secure online payment functionality.
- **Shopping Cart**: A fully functional cart for customers to manage their orders before checkout.
- **Admin Management**: Tools for the restaurant owner or admin to manage orders and products efficiently.

## Technologies Used

Miami Delights was built using the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: Framework for the front-end and server-side rendering.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing application data.
- **TanStack Query**: Data-fetching and state management library.
- **React Formik**: Form handling and validation.
- **Zod Validation**: Schema validation for forms and API.
- **ShadCN UI**: UI components for a sleek and responsive design.
- **Vercel Hosting**: Deployment platform for the application.
- **Supabase**: Database hosting and backend-as-a-service.

The project is hosted on **Vercel** with a **Supabase**-hosted database to ensure scalability and reliability.
